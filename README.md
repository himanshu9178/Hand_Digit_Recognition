# HAND DIGIT RECOGNITION

### Introduction
[The Paper.pdf](https://github.com/himanshu9178/Hand_Digit_Recognition_using_CNN/files/12322628/The.Paper.pdf)

#### Hand-digit recognition serves as a foundational project in the world of computer vision, bridging the gap between the physical realm of handwriting and the digital world of data interpretation. By selecting this as a project, I aimed to understand the intricate processes of image data handling, preprocessing, and model training that underpin more complex computer vision tasks. The simplicity yet profound significance of transforming handwritten digits into machine-readable form epitomizes the transformative power of computer vision. As a starting point, it provides a hands-on experience in deep learning while paving the way for tackling more advanced challenges in the field.
### Project Summary
#### A machine learning project dedicated to recognizing handwritten digits. Leveraging the power of neural networks and the renowned MNIST dataset, this repository showcases the journey from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Dive in to explore the challenges of computer vision and the solutions provided by deep learning (Well Specially in this case the Convolutional Neural Network).
### The MNIST Dataset
#### The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a cornerstone in the machine learning and computer vision communities. Comprising a vast collection of 70,000 handwritten digits, it's split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale snapshot, 28x28 pixels in size, representing digits from 0 to 9. Due to its simplicity and size, MNIST has been pivotal as a beginner's dataset for classification tasks, offering an introductory peek into the challenges and methodologies of deep learning and pattern recognition.
